## About

Offload all of your photo-editing needs with Mosaic! Simply select an image from the gallery (or provide your own image URL), describe your photo-editing needs, and click submit. Our team of photo editors will then edit your photo for you.

## Tech Overview

This was my first web project (nodb) at DevMountain and is a mini-clone of Mendr. This project was completed in 5 days using React, Express, Node, and two separate APIs. I used the Picsum API for the photo gallery and the Ribbet API for the in-browser photo-editor. 

## Primary features:

- Browse and select photo to be edited
- Submit new photo edit request
- Edit/delete requests
- View/dl high-res version of photo
- Edit photo in-browser and export completed edit URL
